# CAIST

**C**ertificate **A**uthority implemented at **I**nstituto **S**uperior **T**Ã©cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal

CAIST is a a simplified certification authority SOAP web service.

CAIST is implemented in the Java programming language using the JAX-WS library (Java API for XML Web Services.


## Getting Started

CAIST is composed of 3 modules:
* cert-util - certificate utility library
* ca-ws - the certificate authority server
* ca-ws-cli - the certificate authority client

There are also bash scripts to generate the required keys and certificates.


### Prerequisites

CAIST requires Java Developer Kit 8 running on Linux, Windows or Mac.
Maven 3 is also required.

To confirm that you have it installed, open a terminal and type:

```
javac -version

mvn -version
```


### Installing

You can find instructions for each component in their folder:
* [cert-util](cert-util/)
* [ca-ws](ca-ws/)
* [ca-ws-cli](ca-ws-cli/).
